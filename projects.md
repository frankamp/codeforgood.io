### Meet our projects!

We're so excited to work with our partner organizations. There's still time to
suggest a project if you have a [great one in mind](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDhmp0I_qW08biCxt0uMwvAkWmLvwkWefZ4_Yt9NgEASKBrA/viewform)!.

#### Sisters of the Road Cafe

[Sisters of the Road Cafe](http://sistersoftheroad.org/) is a nonprofit Cafe in
Portlandâ€™s Old Town neighborhood working to create systemic change that will end
poverty and homelessness forever by providing nourishing meals in a safe,
dignified space. We're partnering with them to help improve their system for
tracking volunteer hours and meal credits.

#### Know Your City

[Know Your City](http://knowyourcity.org/) engages the public in art and social
justice through creative placemaking projects. Our programs and publications aim
to educate people to better know their communities, and to empower them to take
action. We'll be helping them set up an interactive map of Portland that
highlights important historical and cultural sights that might otherwise go
unseen by residents and visitors alike.

#### More to come!

We're finalizing project ideas with organizations like Free Geek, the World
Wildlife Federation, PDX Resistance, and Terra Ref. If you want to suggest a
project for us to work
on,
